I'm a long-time software developer who got into the web3 world via [MetaGame](//discord.gg/metagame) around January 2021. I'm currently fasinated by [Ceramic Network](//ceramic.network) and have several repositories with various experiments.

At the time of this writing, my major projects are:
* Using [Ceramic](//ceramic.network)'s [IDX](//idx.xyz) as the source of truth for [MetaGame](//metagame.wtf)'s [MyMeta leaderboard](//my.metagame.wft).
* Creating a token which gives a purchacer of a [MetaFactory](//metafactory.ai) drop a [virtual wearable](//github.com/MetaFactoryAI/wearable-nft/).
* Developing an [interface](//github.com/dysbulic/consult/) for associating time-aligned metainformation with recordings of pair programming sessions and conference calls as part of my participation in [ETHOnline](//online.ethglobal.com).
* In the periphery is [work](//observablehq.com/@dysbulic/metagame-contributions-explorer) with [SourceCred](//sourcecred.io) with my current goal being to load the contributions graph into [Neo4j](//neo4j.com).
* And always in the background is relinguishing my plans for social revolution. I'm contemplating [the calendar](//z13cdn.web.app) and trying to align [13 teams](//github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/blob/master/13-13s.md#thirteen-thirteens) with [13 sets of characterisitics](//dhappy.github.io/13-13s/).
